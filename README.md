### Getting Started

Welcome to Escape the Cloud!

In this challenge, you’ll get some hands on experience with AWS services related to both the usage and security features of each service. For each service, we will present you with a mission that you’ll need to solve.

Please read the following guidelines carefully in order to complete the tasks:
Every mission ends with a secret and a hint for the next mission. Please keep any information you find in a safe place, as you may need it on another missions as you progress through the challenge.

1. Every mission focuses on a single AWS service. While working on a specific service, you are not required to explore other services in the AWS console.
2. The challenge was built and designed for educational purposes. We’re encouraging you to explore the AWS services and try to unblock resources in order to access them and progress through the challenge.
